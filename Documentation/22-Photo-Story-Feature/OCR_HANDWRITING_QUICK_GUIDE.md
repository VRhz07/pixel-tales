## 📸 Photography Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:

| Tip | Why It Matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **Use block letters** | Tesseract recognizes printed-style letters best |
| **Dark pen + white paper** | High contrast = better recognition |
| **Good lighting** | Avoid shadows and dim conditions |
| **Perpendicular angle** | Reduces distortion |
| **Keep steady** | Blurry images = poor results |
| **Write larger** | Bigger text = more detail captured |

### ❌ DON'T:

| Avoid | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| **Cursive writing** | Lower accuracy (40-60% vs 70-85%) |
| **Light pencil** | Low contrast with paper |
| **Shadows** | Creates uneven lighting |
| **Angled photos** | Distorts letter shapes |
| **Glossy paper** | Creates glare |
| **Small writing** | Not enough detail |

---

## 🎯 Expected Accuracy

| Handwriting Style | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Clear block letters | 70-85% |
| Mixed print/cursive | 60-75% |
| Pure cursive | 40-60% |
| Very messy | 20-40% |

**For comparison:** Printed text = 85-95%
