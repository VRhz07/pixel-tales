```

===========================================

RESULT OF THESE CHANGES:
=========================

1. Gemini will see MANDATORY markers making requirements crystal clear
2. Gemini will have 5 total examples showing different scenarios:
   - Example 1 (existing): Wide establishing shot
   - Example 2 (existing): Multi-character scene
   - Example 3 (NEW): Action scene with dynamic camera
   - Example 4 (NEW): Emotional close-up
   - Example 5 (NEW): Dramatic climax

3. Each example demonstrates:
   ✅ Explicit camera angle
   ✅ Character positioning in frame
   ✅ Detailed lighting description
   ✅ Atmospheric effects
   ✅ Quality keywords

4. Expected improvement: 60% → 90%+ prompt quality
